# VOLUME pointing to "/tmp" because that is where a Spring Boot application
# creates working directories for Tomcat by default. The effect is to create
# a temporary file on your host under "/var/lib/docker" and link it to the container
# under "/tmp". This step is optional for the simple app that we wrote here, but
# can be necessary for other Spring Boot applications if they need to actually write in the filesystem.
VOLUME /tmp

# The project JAR file is ADDed to the container as "app.jar"
ADD dockerized-spring-boot-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar app.jar

# RUN command to "touch" the jar file so that it has a file modification time
# (Docker creates all container files in an "unmodified" state by default).
# This actually isnâ€™t important for the simple app that we wrote, but any static
# content (e.g. "index.html") would require the file to have a modification time.
RUN bash -c 'touch /app.jar'

# To reduce Tomcat startup time we added a system property pointing to "/dev/urandom"
# as a source of entropy.
